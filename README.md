# Conference Ticket Booking System in Go
Welcome to the Conference Ticket Booking System, a simple and efficient solution written in the Go programming language. This application allows users to book conference tickets by providing their first name, last name, email, and the number of tickets they require. The system includes input validation to ensure a smooth and error-free experience.
## Features:
User-Friendly Interface: A straightforward command-line interface that guides users through the ticket booking process.

Input Validation: Ensures the correctness of user-provided information. The first name must be longer than 2 characters, and the email must contain the '@' symbol.

Real-time Ticket Availability: Displays the remaining number of tickets available after each booking, keeping users informed about the current status.

Infinite Booking Loop: The system operates in an infinite loop, allowing users to make multiple bookings without restarting the application.
